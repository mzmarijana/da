								<b>A Family of Independent Oil Explorers</b><br><br>
								In the early days of the twentieth century the oil exploration business began to boom as the discovery of very commercial oil and gas fields in East Texas were discovered and developed to great success. The Darsey Family became seriously involved in the oil exploration business in the 1930s when Darsey Jr. graduted from the University of Texas. The rather frantic activity of oil leasing was growing fast and centered in East Texas and more particularly in Houston.
								<br><br>
								Soon after his graduation W.K. Darsey Jr. moved from Grapeland, to Houston, Texas.  _______________ the financial activity of the associated land activities were located and where he was first employed in the commercial banking as a fresh new graduate with a business degree. Coincidentally, leasing activity soon involved several activities in and around Houston County where Darsey was well acclimated with land ownership and where the Darsey family owned land and minerals _________ held in Houston and Anderson Counties.
								<br><span class="image main"><img src="images/about2.PNG" alt="" /></span>	<br>
								This rather frantic activity would soon involve the family lands and many business associates of his family soon drew the young, ambitious business graduates into weekend trips from Houston to his home with one of the first independent land brokers in East Texas, Jim Valentine. Darsey and Valentine were soon associated in a partnership brokerage company. Darsey the more active of the two soon moved to Tyler, Texas which had become a regional focus for oil company officials and their associated lease acquisitions activities. Darsey lived in Tyler for about 15 years and bought oil and gas leases all over East Texas. As the business spread ________________________ the successful growth of East Texas Field throughout the 15 counties around it.
								<br><br>
								As Darsey's business grew he moved his office to Austin, Texas from which he moved the focus of his leasing business to the South of Texas, in and around Corpus Christi in Nueces County. One of the areas which interested him soon after he moved to Austin was a shallow 2500 foot oil field in Frio County called Bigfoot Field. Darsey, because of his serious interest in this area for the first time, bought personally owned oil leases in the area which he developed as an independent oil operator. From this point on Darsey owned and developed many small areas of lease hold throughout East and South Texas. Darsey was soon an owner of more than 100 wells in the ____________________________________.
								<br><br>
								W.G. Darsey, Jr. in Austin had a son, who growing up in the Austin, became a student at the University of Texas and graduated as a geologist. After his education at the University of Texas and subsequent graduate school at the University of Oklahoma and Rice Institute in Houston. After his university education W.G. Darsey Jr.'s son, Bill Darsey worked for 5 years for the union producing company, a subsidiary of Unified Gas Corp. in South Texas and South Louisiana and went independent in Lafayette, Louisiana. As an independent geologist W.G. Darsey, Bill Darsey, worked in South Louisiana, South Texas and later in the Middle East while focused in Egypt as the Executive Vice President of Transworld Independent Producing Company.
								<br><span class="image main"><img src="images/about3.PNG" alt="" /></span><br>
								Darsey moved to Houston in 1986 and has worked as an independent geologist and Vice President of Trace Oil and Gas Company in Houston. Trace has ___________ successfully leased, sold and drilled many exploration leases throughout the Eagleford and Trio Trends of South Texas ______________ to Darsey's retirement in 2016. 
								<br><br>
								Now Rig Darsey, W.G. Darsey, IV, has opened an independent  brokerage business to be called  Darsey and Associates LLC. After some years of contract brokerage with Jim Mc____________________ and others working as a contract broker ________ has set out to carry on the family tradition of the independent oil business. He is well prepared to do so.
